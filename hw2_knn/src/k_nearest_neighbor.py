        K-Nearest Neighbor is a straightforward algorithm that can be highly
        effective. Training time is...well...is there any training? At test time, labels for
        new points are predicted by comparing them to the nearest neighbors in the
        training data.

        ```distance_measure``` lets you switch between which distance measure you will
        use to compare data points. The behavior is as follows:

        If 'euclidean', use euclidean_distances, if 'manhattan', use manhattan_distances.

        ```aggregator``` lets you alter how a label is predicted for a data point based 
        on its neighbors. If it's set to `mean`, it is the mean of the labels of the
        neighbors. If it's set to `mode`, it is the mode of the labels of the neighbors.
        If it is set to median, it is the median of the labels of the neighbors. If the
        number of dimensions returned in the label is more than 1, the aggregator is
        applied to each dimension independently. For example, if the labels of 3 
        closest neighbors are:
            [
                [1, 2, 3], 
                [2, 3, 4], 
                [3, 4, 5]
            ] 
        And the aggregator is 'mean', applied along each dimension, this will return for 
        that point:
            [
                [2, 3, 4]
            ]

        Arguments:
            n_neighbors {int} -- Number of neighbors to use for prediction.
            distance_measure {str} -- Which distance measure to use. Can be one of
                'euclidean' or 'manhattan'. This is the distance measure
                that will be used to compare features to produce labels. 
            aggregator {str} -- How to aggregate a label across the `n_neighbors` nearest
                neighbors. Can be one of 'mode', 'mean', or 'median'.
